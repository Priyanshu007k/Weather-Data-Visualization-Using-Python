# Weather-Data-Visualization-Using-Python

# Weather Data Analysis Project

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a historical weather dataset. It uses Python's powerful data science libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` to explore trends and patterns in weather data.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is:
- **Source:** `weatherHistory.csv`
- **Description:** Includes historical weather records with features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Project Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Summary statistics
- Data visualization (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps)
- Initial insights from data patterns

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
